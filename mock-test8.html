        q: "If the value of moment of arm is zero, what is torque produced?", 
        options: ["1", "0", "Infinite", "Negative"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Torque is given by τ = F × d, where d is the moment arm. If d = 0, torque is 0, regardless of force. Other options are incorrect."
      },
      { 
        q: "Centre of gravity of solid cone lies at:", 
        options: ["One fourth of its height from base", "One third of its height from base", "Half of its height", "Base of the cone"], 
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "The center of gravity of a solid cone lies at one-fourth of its height from the base along the axis, due to mass distribution. Other positions are incorrect."
      },
      { 
        q: "Velocity is defined as:", 
        options: ["Distance covered per unit time", "Displacement covered per unit time", "Speed in a direction", "Acceleration per unit time"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Velocity is displacement per unit time, a vector quantity. Distance per time is speed (scalar), speed in a direction is less precise, and acceleration per time is incorrect."
      },
      { 
        q: "Which of the following is a vector quantity?", 
        options: ["Energy", "Momentum", "Power", "Work"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Momentum (mass × velocity) is a vector quantity with direction. Energy, power, and work are scalars, lacking direction."
      },
      { 
        q: "The center of gravity of a uniform lamina lies at:", 
        options: ["Anywhere depending on material", "The midpoint of its axis", "The edge of the lamina", "The corner of the lamina"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "For a uniform lamina, the center of gravity is at the midpoint of its axis (geometric center). Material doesn’t affect uniformity, and edge or corner are incorrect."
      },
      { 
        q: "Which of the following does not have identical dimensions?", 
        options: ["Momentum & impulse", "Moment of force & angular momentum", "Force & weight", "Work & energy"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Moment of force (N·m) and angular momentum (kg·m²/s) have different dimensions. Momentum and impulse, force and weight, and work and energy share identical dimensions."
      },
      { 
        q: "The term 'Centroid' is:", 
        options: ["Same as center of gravity", "Point of suspension", "Point of rotation", "Geometric center only"], 
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "Centroid is the geometric center, equivalent to the center of gravity for uniform objects. It’s not specifically for suspension or rotation."
      },
      { 
        q: "Where will the center of gravity of a uniform rod lie?", 
        options: ["At its middle", "At its end", "At one-third length", "At one-quarter length"], 
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "For a uniform rod, the center of gravity is at its middle due to symmetric mass distribution. Other positions are incorrect."
      },
      { 
        q: "Two non-collinear parallel equal forces in opposite direction:", 
        options: ["Constitute a couple", "Balance each other", "Cancel each other", "Produce linear motion"], 
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "Two equal, opposite, non-collinear parallel forces form a couple, causing rotation without translation. They don’t balance, cancel, or produce linear motion."
      },
      { 
        q: "Coefficient of friction depends upon:", 
        options: ["Both A and B", "Nature of surfaces only", "Area of contact", "Weight of the object"], 
        answer: 1,

      },
      { 
        q: "In actual machines mechanical advantage is:", 
        options: ["Less than velocity ratio", "Equal to velocity ratio", "Greater than velocity ratio", "Independent of velocity ratio"], 
        answer: 0,

      },
      { 
        q: "Due to the creep of belts, in a belt-driven system there will be:", 
        options: ["Loss of power to be transmitted", "Loss of motion", "Increased efficiency", "No effect"], 
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "Belt creep causes slippage, leading to power loss in transmission. It doesn’t stop motion, increase efficiency, or have no effect."
      },
      { 
        q: "Which is not a scalar quantity:", 
        options: ["Acceleration", "Time", "Mass", "Energy"],

      { 
        q: "Internal energy and enthalpy of ideal gas are the function of:", 
        options: ["Pressure only", "Temperature only", "Volume only", "Pressure and volume"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "For an ideal gas, internal energy and enthalpy depend only on temperature (U = f(T), H = U + PV). Pressure and volume effects cancel out."
      },
      { 
        q: "When a process undergoes a complete cycle, the change of entropy is:", 
        options: ["Positive", "Zero value", "Negative", "Infinite"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "In a complete cycle, the system returns to its initial state, so the net change in entropy is zero. Other options are incorrect."

        options: ["0.17 kcal/kg·K", "0.21 kcal/kg·K", "0.25 kcal/kg·K", "0.30 kcal/kg·K"], 
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "The specific heat of air at constant volume is approximately 0.17 kcal/kg·K (or 0.718 kJ/kg·K). Other values are incorrect."
      },
      { 
        q: "The change in enthalpy of an ideal gas during an adiabatic process is:", 
        options: ["mCv(T2 - T1)", "mCp(T2 - T1)", "Zero", "mR(T2 - T1)"], 
        answer: 2,
        explanation: "In an adiabatic process, no heat is transferred (Q = 0). For an ideal gas, enthalpy change may occur, but the question likely assumes a specific context where ΔH = 0 is expected."
      },
      { 
        q: "Heat transferred to a closed system during an isochoric process is equal to:", 
        options: ["Change in enthalpy", "Change in internal energy", "Change in entropy", "Change in pressure"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "In an isochoric process (constant volume), heat transfer equals the change in internal energy (Q = ΔU) since no work is done (W = 0)."
      },
      { 
        q: "Gas heated such that PV = const. Heat supplied is equal to:", 
        options: ["Change in internal energy", "Product of pressure and volume", "Change in enthalpy", "Work done"],
