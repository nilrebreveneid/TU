    const questions = [
  {
    "q": "The unit of temperature is based on:",
    "options": ["Boiling point of mercury", "Triple point of water", "Freezing point of alcohol", "Melting point of ice"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "The Kelvin scale is defined using the triple point of water (273.16 K). Boiling mercury, freezing alcohol, and melting ice are not standard references for temperature units."
  },
  {
    "q": "Absolute zero temperature is taken as:",
    "options": ["237°C", "-273°C", "0°C", "-237°C"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Absolute zero is approximately -273.15°C, where molecular motion theoretically stops. Other values are incorrect and do not represent absolute zero."
  },
  {
    "q": "Essential condition for heat transfer is:",
    "options": ["Difference in conductivity", "Difference in temperature", "Same temperature", "High pressure"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Heat flows from higher to lower temperature per thermodynamic principles. Conductivity affects the rate, same temperature prevents flow, and pressure is secondary."
  },
  {
    "q": "A constant volume air thermometer works on:",
    "options": ["Archimedes’ principle", "Charles’ Law", "Boyle’s Law", "Avogadro’s Law"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Charles’ Law (P ∝ T at constant volume) governs constant volume thermometers. Archimedes’ principle is unrelated, Boyle’s Law applies to constant temperature, and Avogadro’s Law involves moles."
  },
  {
    "q": "The greater the temperature difference:",
    "options": ["Lower is the heat transfer rate", "Higher is the heat transfer rate", "No effect on rate", "Inversely proportional"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Larger temperature differences increase heat transfer rate per Fourier’s or Newton’s laws. Lower rate, no effect, or inverse proportionality contradict thermodynamics."
  },
  {
    "q": "The calorific value of gaseous fuel is expressed in:",
    "options": ["kcal/min", "kcal/m³", "kcal/kg", "kcal/s"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Calorific value for gases is typically in kcal/m³, reflecting energy per unit volume. kcal/kg is for solids/liquids, and kcal/min or kcal/s are rates, not energy content."
  },
  {
    "q": "When expansion/compression follows PVⁿ = constant, it is:",
    "options": ["Hyperbolic process", "Polytropic process", "Isothermal process", "Adiabatic process"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "PVⁿ = constant defines a polytropic process, encompassing various processes depending on n. Hyperbolic is PV = constant, isothermal is T constant, and adiabatic has a specific n."
  },
  {
    "q": "Change in enthalpy equals heat supplied at:",
    "options": ["Constant temperature", "Constant pressure", "Constant volume", "Adiabatic conditions"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Enthalpy change (ΔH = Q) occurs at constant pressure per the first law (Q = ΔU + PΔV). Constant volume relates to internal energy, constant temperature is not specific, and adiabatic implies no heat."
  },
  {
    "q": "The value of Cp/Cv for air is:",
    "options": ["1.2", "1.4", "1.0", "1.6"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "For air (a diatomic gas), Cp/Cv (γ) is approximately 1.4 at standard conditions. 1.0 implies isothermal behavior, and 1.2 or 1.6 are incorrect for air."
  },
  {
    "q": "Isothermal and adiabatic processes are identical at:",
    "options": ["Saturation temperature", "Critical temperature", "Absolute zero", "Boiling point"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "At the critical temperature, gas properties may cause isothermal and adiabatic processes to exhibit similar behavior due to minimal state changes. Saturation temperature, absolute zero, and boiling point are unrelated."
  },
  {
    "q": "The property of a working substance that increases or decreases as heat is supplied or removed:",
    "options": ["External energy", "Internal energy", "Kinetic energy", "Potential energy"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Internal energy changes with heat addition or removal per the first law (ΔU = Q - W). External, kinetic, and potential energies are not directly tied to heat transfer in this context."
  },
  {
    "q": "A gas behaves as an ideal gas at:",
    "options": ["Very high pressure", "Low pressure", "High temperature only", "Low temperature"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Ideal gas behavior is best at low pressure and high temperature, where intermolecular forces are negligible. High pressure or low temperature causes deviations, and temperature alone is insufficient."
  },
  {
    "q": "The efficiency of the Joule cycle is:",
    "options": ["Greater than Carnot cycle", "Less than Carnot cycle", "Equal to Carnot cycle", "Independent of temperature"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "The Joule (Brayton) cycle is less efficient than the Carnot cycle, which sets the maximum efficiency limit. Equality or independence from temperature is incorrect."
  },
  {
    "q": "In water cooling, water in the jacket obtains heat due to:",
    "options": ["Radiation", "All of the above", "Conduction only", "Convection only"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Heat transfer to cooling water involves conduction (through cylinder walls), convection (within the jacket), and minor radiation. ‘All of the above’ is correct."
  },
  {
    "q": "Heat engine attains 100% thermal efficiency: it violates:",
    "options": ["First law of thermodynamics", "Second law of thermodynamics", "Zeroth law", "Third law"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "100% efficiency violates the second law, which states some heat must be rejected to a cold reservoir. The first law concerns energy conservation, and zeroth/third laws are unrelated."
  },
  {
    "q": "Suction, compression, expansion, and exhaust strokes take place in:",
    "options": ["Steam engine", "Diesel engine", "Gas turbine", "Rankine cycle engine"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Diesel engines operate with these four strokes in a four-stroke cycle. Steam engines and Rankine cycle engines use continuous processes, and gas turbines lack distinct strokes."
  },
  {
    "q": "Which power plant engine is rarely used in civil aircraft?",
    "options": ["None of the above", "Turbo propeller engine", "Turbojet engine", "Turbofan engine"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Turbo propeller engines are less common in modern civil aircraft, which favor turbojets or turbofans for efficiency and speed. ‘None of the above’ is incorrect."
  },
  {
    "q": "Second law of thermodynamics defines:",
    "options": ["Work", "Entropy", "Internal energy", "Enthalpy"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "The second law introduces entropy, a measure of disorder. Work, internal energy, and enthalpy are defined by the first law or other principles."
  },
  {
    "q": "Internal energy and enthalpy of ideal gas are the function of:",
    "options": ["Pressure only", "Temperature only", "Volume only", "Pressure and volume"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "For ideal gases, internal energy (U) and enthalpy (H = U + PV) depend only on temperature, as PV = nRT eliminates other dependencies."
  },
  {
    "q": "When a process undergoes a complete cycle, the change of entropy is:",
    "options": ["Positive", "Zero", "Negative", "Infinite"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "For a reversible cycle, entropy change is zero as the system returns to its initial state. Irreversible cycles increase entropy, but the question implies reversibility."
  },
  {
    "q": "The specific heat of air at constant volume is equal to:",
    "options": ["0.17 kcal/kg·K", "0.21 kcal/kg·K", "0.24 kcal/kg·K", "0.15 kcal/kg·K"],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "Specific heat at constant volume for air is approximately 0.17 kcal/kg·K (~0.718 kJ/kg·K in SI units). Other values are incorrect or approximate Cp."
  },
  {
    "q": "The change in enthalpy of an ideal gas during an adiabatic process is:",
    "options": ["mCᵥ(T₂ − T₁)", "mCₚ(T₂ − T₁)", "Zero", "mR(T₂ − T₁)"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Enthalpy change for an ideal gas is ΔH = mCₚ(T₂ − T₁), even in adiabatic processes, as H depends on temperature. Cᵥ relates to internal energy, zero is incorrect, and R is the gas constant."
  },
  {
    "q": "Heat transferred to a closed system during an isochoric process is equal to:",
    "options": ["Change in enthalpy", "Change in internal energy", "Change in work", "Zero"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "For an isochoric (constant volume) process, Q = ΔU (first law, W = 0). Enthalpy change applies to constant pressure, work is zero, and heat is not zero unless specified."
  },
  {
    "q": "Gas heated such that PV = constant, heat supplied is equal to:",
    "options": ["Work done", "Product of pressure and volume", "Change in enthalpy", "Zero"],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "For an isothermal process (PV = constant, T constant), ΔU = 0 for an ideal gas, so Q = W (first law). Work is the heat supplied, not PV, enthalpy, or zero."
  },
  {
    "q": "Water at 48 kg/cm² and 160°C when exposed to atmosphere will:",
    "options": ["Cool down", "Flash i.e. get converted into steam", "Remain liquid", "Freeze"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Water at 48 kg/cm² (~4.7 MPa) and 160°C is under high pressure. At atmospheric pressure (~0.1 MPa), it flashes to steam due to lower boiling point (~100°C). Cooling, remaining liquid, or freezing is unlikely."
  },
  {
    "q": "The device that converts heat energy into work during a cyclic process is:",
    "options": ["Heat pump", "Heat engine", "Refrigerator", "Compressor"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Heat engines convert heat to work in a cyclic process, operating on cycles like Carnot Carnot or Rankine cycle. Heat pumps and refrigerators move heat, refrigerators move heat and compressors do work, not heat-to-work conversion."
  },
  {
    "q": "Work done in a free expansion process is:",
    "options": ["Positive", "Zero", "Negative", "Infinite"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "In free expansion (expansion into a vacuum), no external pressure is exerted, so W = PΔV = 0. Positive, negative, or infinite work are incorrect as no work is done."
  },
  {
    "q": "Which coal has the highest calorific value?",
    "options": ["Bituminous coal", "Anthracite coal", "Lignite coal", "Peat coal"],
    "answer": "coal", "coal": 1,
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Anthracite coal has the highest calorific value due to its high carbon content (~90%). Bituminous (~70%), lignite (~50%), and peat (~40%) have lower values."
  },
  {
    "q": "In an isothermal process:",
    "options": ["There is no change in enthalpy", "All of the above", "Change in internal energy", "Change in entropy"],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "For an ideal gas in an isothermal process (T constant), ΔH = 0 as H depends on temperature. ΔU = 0, but entropy may change. ‘All of the above’ is incorrect."
  },
  {
    "q": "According to the 1st Law of Thermodynamics:",
    "options": ["Mass and light are mutually convertible", "Heat and work are mutually convertible", "Energy is destroyed", "Entropy is conserved"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "The first law states that heat and work are mutually convertible (Q = ΔU + W). Mass-light conversion is relativity, energy is conserved, and entropy relates to the second law."
  },
  {
    "q": "Which parameter changes during an isothermal process?",
    "options": ["Pressure or volume", "Temperature", "Internal energy", "Enthalpy"],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "In an isothermal process, temperature is constant, so pressure and volume change (PV = nRT). Internal energy and enthalpy remain constant for ideal gases."
  },
