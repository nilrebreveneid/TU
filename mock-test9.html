    const questions = [
      // Applied Mechanics (13 MCQs)
      { 
        q: "The work done is said to be zero when:", 
        options: ["Force acts on a body, but displacement takes place", "No force acts on a body, but displacement is zero", "Force and displacement are perpendicular", "All of the above"], 
        answer: 2,
        explanation: "Work is zero when force and displacement are perpendicular (W = F · d · cosθ, cos 90° = 0). Option A is incorrect as work depends on displacement, and B is incorrect as zero force yields zero work."
      },
      { 
        q: "Which law states Energy can neither be created nor destroyed:", 
        options: ["Newton’s first law", "First law of thermodynamics", "Newton’s third law", "Law of conservation of momentum"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "The first law of thermodynamics states energy conservation, neither created nor destroyed. Newton’s laws address motion, and momentum conservation is a different principle."
      },
      { 
        q: "In a couple, the lines of action of the forces are:", 
        options: ["Perpendicular", "Parallel", "Collinear", "Intersecting"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "A couple consists of two equal, opposite forces with parallel, non-collinear lines of action, causing rotation. Perpendicular or intersecting forces don’t form a couple."
      },
      { 
        q: "On a ladder leaning against a smooth vertical wall, the friction acts:", 
        options: ["Zero at its upper end", "Upward at its upper end", "Downward at its lower end", "Perpendicular at its middle"], 
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "A smooth wall has no friction, so friction is zero at the ladder’s upper end. Friction acts at the lower end against the floor, not as described in other options."
      },
      { 
        q: "Effect of a force on a body depends upon:", 
        options: ["Magnitude", "All of the above", "Direction", "Point of application"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "A force’s effect depends on its magnitude, direction, and point of application, so ‘all of the above’ is correct."
      },
      { 
        q: "A rigid body is in a stable equilibrium if the application of any force:", 
        options: ["Can raise the CG of the body but cannot lower it", "Tends to lower the CG of the body", "Has no effect on CG", "Rotates the body"], 
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "In stable equilibrium, forces raise the center of gravity (CG), returning it to the original position upon release. Lowering the CG or rotation indicates instability."
      },
      { 
        q: "FPS unit ‘Pound’ is the unit to measure:", 
        options: ["Length", "Weight", "Force", "Mass"], 
        answer: 2,
        explanation: "In the FPS system, the pound is a unit of force. Weight is a force, but mass is measured in slugs, and length in feet."
      },
      { 
        q: "The center of gravity of a plane lamina will not be at its geometric center if it is a:", 
        q: "The center of gravity of a plane lamina will not be at its geometric center if it is:", 
        options: ["Rectangle", "Right-angled triangle", "Circle", "Square"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "For a right-angled triangle, the center of gravity is not at the geometric center but at the centroid (1/3 from base and height). Rectangle, circle, and square have CG at their centers."
      },
      { 
        q: "Force acting on 1 gram mass creating 1 cm/sec² acceleration is called:", 
        options: ["Horsepower", "Dyne", "Newton", "Watt"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "A dyne is the CGS unit of force, causing 1 g·cm/s² acceleration. Newton is SI, horsepower and watt are power units."
      },
      { 
        q: "Non-coplanar forces are those which:", 
        options: ["Coplanar concurrent forces", "Do not lie in the same plane", "Are parallel", "Intersect at one point"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Non-coplanar forces do not lie in the same plane. Coplanar forces are in one plane, and parallel or intersecting forces may still be coplanar."
      },
      { 
        q: "Which situation is a projectile?", 
        options: ["Lifting of a bag", "Throwing a stone", "Pushing a cart", "Dropping a stone"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Throwing a stone involves projectile motion, with both horizontal and vertical components under gravity. Lifting, pushing, or dropping are not projectile motions."
      },
      { 
        q: "Resultant of two forces P and Q (P > Q) in opposite direction is:", 
        options: ["P + Q", "P - Q", "Q - P", "P × Q"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "For forces P and Q in opposite directions, the resultant is P - Q (in P’s direction) since P > Q. Other options are incorrect."
      },
      { 
        q: "Young’s modulus of elasticity of a perfectly plastic body is:", 
        options: ["One", "Zero", "Infinite", "Negative"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Young’s modulus for a perfectly plastic body is zero, as it deforms without elastic recovery. Other values don’t apply."
      },

      // Thermodynamics (8 MCQs)
      { 
        q: "In an isothermal process:", 
        options: ["There is no change in enthalpy", "All of the", "Temperature is constant", "Pressure is constant"], 
        answer: 2,
        explanation: "An isothermal process maintains constant temperature. Enthalpy or pressure may change, and ‘all’ is incorrect."
      },
      { 
        q: "Which characteristic does not change in a reversible isothermal process?", 
        options: ["Enthalpy", "Entropy", "Internal energy", "Temperature"], 
        answer: 3,
        explanation: "In a reversible isothermal process, temperature remains constant. Internal energy, enthalpy, and entropy may change for ideal gases."
      },
      { 
        q: "For any natural process, the entropy change would be:", 
        options: ["Negative", "Positive", "Zero", "Infinite"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Natural (irreversible) processes increase the system’s entropy (positive change) per the second law. Zero is for reversible processes."
      },
      { 
        q: "Which laws apply to behavior of perfect gas?", 
        options: ["Boyle’s law", "Both Boyle’s law and Charles’s law", "Avogadro’s law", "Graham’s law"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Both Boyle’s law (PV = constant) and Charles’s law (V/T = constant) apply to ideal gases. Avogadro’s law relates moles, and Graham’s law is for diffusion."
      },
      { 
        q: "Increase in entropy of a system means:", 
        options: ["Increase in availability of energy", "Degradation of energy", "Conservation of energy", "Reduction of energy"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Increased entropy indicates energy degradation, reducing its availability for work. It’s not conservation or reduction of energy."
      },
      { 
        q: "Step 2 in Carnot cycle is:", 
        options: ["Isentropic compression", "Isentropic expansion", "Isothermal expansion", "Isothermal compression"], 
        answer: 2,
        explanation: "The Carnot cycle’s second step is isothermal expansion (heat absorption at constant temperature). Other steps occur later."
      },
      { 
        q: "As octane number increases, knocking tendency of petrol engine:", 
        options: ["Increases", "Decreases", "Remains same", "Becomes unpredictable"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Higher octane numbers reduce knocking in petrol engines by improving fuel stability. Knocking doesn’t increase or remain unchanged."
      },
      { 
        q: "Closeness of measured value to true value is:", 
        options: ["Precision", "Accuracy", "Error", "Reliability"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Accuracy measures how close a value is to the true value. Precision is consistency, error is deviation, and reliability is dependability."
      },

      { 
        q: "A projection that shows three faces of an object equally is called:", 
        options: ["Isometric projection", "Orthographic projection", "Perspective projection", "Oblique projection"], 
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "Isometric projection shows three faces equally at 120° angles. Orthographic shows one face, perspective mimics human vision, and oblique distorts one axis."
