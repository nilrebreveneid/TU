      // Applied Mechanics (27 MCQs, duplicates replaced)
      { 
        q: "A system of three forces acts on a body and keeps it in equilibrium. The forces need to be:", 
        options: ["Coplanar only", "Coplanar may or may not be concurrent", "Concurrent only", "Non-coplanar"], 
        answer: 2,
        explanation: "For three forces to maintain equilibrium, they must be concurrent (meet at a point) and their vector sum must be zero. Coplanar alone is insufficient, and non-coplanar forces complicate equilibrium."
      },
      { 
        q: "Which of the following situation constitutes a projectile?", 
        options: ["Lifting of a balloon", "Launching of a satellite", "Pushing a cart", "Rolling a ball"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Launching a satellite involves projectile motion with initial velocity and gravitational influence. Lifting, pushing, or rolling don’t follow a parabolic trajectory."
      },
      { 
        q: "The wheels of a moving car possess:", 
        options: ["Kinetic energy of rotation only", "Kinetic energy of translation and rotation both", "Potential energy only", "Thermal energy"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Car wheels have both translational kinetic energy (linear motion) and rotational kinetic energy (spinning). Potential or thermal energy isn’t primary."
      },
      { 
        q: "Forces always exist in pairs and are equal but opposite:", 
        options: ["Newton’s second law", "Newton’s third law", "Newton’s first law", "Law of gravitation"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Newton’s third law states that for every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction, forming force pairs. Other laws address different principles."
      },
      { 
        q: "A body moves only when:", 
        options: ["Force of friction = applied force", "Force of friction < applied force", "Force of friction > applied force", "No force is applied"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "A body moves when the applied force exceeds friction (F > f). If friction equals or exceeds the applied force, the body remains stationary."
      },
      { 
        q: "Which is not a vector quantity:", 
        options: ["Speed", "Velocity", "Acceleration", "Momentum"], 
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "Speed is a scalar quantity (magnitude only). Velocity, acceleration, and momentum are vectors with magnitude and direction."
      },
      { 
        q: "The coefficient of friction depends on:", 
        options: ["Area of contact", "Strength of surfaces", "Shape of surfaces", "Weight of the object"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "The coefficient of friction depends on surface material and roughness (strength of surfaces). Area, shape, or weight don’t directly affect it."
      },
      { 
        q: "Tension in a cable supporting a lift, when lift is going down is:", 
        options: ["W + f = mg", "W - f = mg", "W = mg", "W = f"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "When a lift moves downward, tension (W) is less than weight (mg) due to downward acceleration, approximated as W - f = mg, where f is the net force."
      },
      { 
        q: "Force when carried by tire:", 
        options: ["Retard its motion", "Introduce internal stress", "Increase velocity", "Reduce friction"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Force on a tire introduces internal stress (deformation). It doesn’t directly retard motion, increase velocity, or reduce friction."
      },
      { 
        q: "Which of the following physical quantity is not a vector quantity?", 
        options: ["Mass", "Momentum", "Velocity", "Force"], 
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "Mass is a scalar quantity. Momentum, velocity, and force are vectors, requiring direction."
      },
      { 
        q: "The work done by a force is zero when:", 
        options: ["Force is zero", "Displacement is zero", "Force and displacement are perpendicular", "All of the above"], 
        answer: 3,
        explanation: "Work is zero if force is zero, displacement is zero, or force and displacement are perpendicular (W = F·d·cosθ, cos 90° = 0). Thus, ‘all of the above’ is correct."
      },
      { 
        q: "The impulse of a force is defined as:", 
        options: ["Force times distance", "Force times time", "Mass times acceleration", "Energy per unit time"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Impulse is force multiplied by time (J = F·t), equal to the change in momentum. Other options describe different quantities."
      },
      { 
        q: "The breakeven point is the point where:", 
        options: ["Fixed and variable cost lines intersect", "Variable and total cost lines intersect", "Sales and profit lines intersect", "Revenue and total cost lines intersect"], 
        answer: 3,
        explanation: "The breakeven point is where total revenue equals total costs (fixed + variable). Fixed and variable cost intersection is incorrect."
      },
      { 
        q: "A company spends considerable amount on publicity to promote sales. This expenditure in break-even chart is shown below the:", 
        options: ["Fixed cost line", "Sales revenue line", "Variable cost line", "Total cost line"], 
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "Publicity costs are fixed costs, plotted below the fixed cost line in a breakeven chart. They don’t vary with production."
      },
      { 
        q: "Break-even analysis consists of:", 
        options: ["Fixed costs", "Fixed and variable costs", "Variable costs only", "Revenue costs"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Breakeven analysis includes both fixed and variable costs to determine the point where revenue covers all costs."
      },
      { 
        q: "If the velocity of 1 m/s is accelerated by 1 m/s² then the velocity after 1 sec will be:", 
        options: ["4 m/s", "3 m/s", "2 m/s", "5 m/s"], 
        answer: 2,
        explanation: "Using v = u + at, initial velocity u = 1 m/s, acceleration a = 1 m/s², time t = 1 s: v = 1 + 1·1 = 2 m/s."
      },
      { 
        q: "The C.G. of a plane lamina will not be at its geometrical center if it is a:", 
        options: ["Equilateral triangle", "Rectangle", "Right-angled triangle", "Circle"], 
        answer: 2,
        explanation: "For a right-angled triangle, the center of gravity is at the centroid (1/3 from base and height), not the geometric center. Others have CG at their centers."
      },
      { 
        q: "There is no acceleration or lift if:", 
        options: ["W = (T – W/g)", "W = T", "W > T", "W < T"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "No acceleration occurs when weight (W) equals tension (T), balancing forces. Other conditions cause upward or downward motion."
      },
      { 
        q: "A force may:", 
        options: ["Retard its motion", "All of the above", "Accelerate its motion", "Change its direction"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "A force can retard, accelerate, or change the direction of motion, so ‘all of the above’ is correct."
      },
      { 
        q: "Power is equal to:", 
        options: ["Work done per minute", "Work done per second", "Force times distance", "Energy per unit time"], 
        answer: 3,
        explanation: "Power is energy per unit time (P = W/t). Work per second is equivalent, but energy per time is the standard definition."
      },
      { 
        q: "The force of friction which exists when the body is in motion is called:", 
        options: ["Static friction", "Dynamic friction", "Rolling friction", "Limiting friction"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Dynamic (kinetic) friction acts during motion. Static friction prevents motion, rolling friction is for rolling objects, and limiting friction is maximum static friction."
      },
      { 
        q: "The statement 'forces always exist in pairs and to every action there is equal but opposite reaction' is:", 
        options: ["Newton’s first law of motion", "Newton’s third law of motion", "Newton’s second law of motion", "Law of conservation of energy"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Newton’s third law describes action-reaction force pairs. Other laws address inertia, acceleration, or energy conservation."
      },
      { 
        q: "Value of acceleration due to gravity (g) on earth’s surface is:", 
        options: ["10 m/s²", "9.8 m/s²", "8.9 m/s²", "11 m/s²"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "The standard value of g is 9.8 m/s² on Earth’s surface. Other values are approximations or incorrect."
      },
      { 
        q: "The statement 'stress is directly proportional to strain within elastic limit' refers to:", 
        options: ["Pascal’s law", "Hooke’s law", "Boyle’s law", "Charles’ law"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Hooke’s law states stress ∝ strain within the elastic limit. Other laws relate to fluids or gases."
      },
      { 
        q: "Maximum range of a particle is at angle:", 
        options: ["30°", "45°", "60°", "90°"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "The maximum range for a projectile occurs at 45°, balancing horizontal and vertical components (R = (u² sin 2θ)/g)."
      },

        q: "One Newton is that force which produces an acceleration of:", 
        options: ["1 m/s² in a mass of 1 gm", "1 m/s² in a mass of 1 kg", "1 cm/s² in a mass of 1 kg", "1 m/s² in a mass of 100 gm"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "One Newton produces 1 m/s² acceleration in a 1 kg mass (F = ma). Other options use incorrect units or masses."
      },
      { 
        q: "The moment of inertia of a circular disc about its diameter is:", 
        options: ["MR²/2", "MR²/4", "MR²", "2MR²/5"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "The moment of inertia of a circular disc about its diameter is I = MR²/4, derived from I = MR²/2 about the perpendicular axis and the perpendicular axis theorem."
      },

      // Thermodynamics (17 MCQs)
      { 
        q: "Water at 48 kg/cm² and 160°C when exposed to atmosphere will:", 
        options: ["Cool down", "Flash i.e. get converted into steam", "Remain liquid", "Solidify"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "At 48 kg/cm², water at 160°C is liquid. At atmospheric pressure (1 bar), it flashes into steam due to a lower boiling point."
      },
      { 
        q: "The device that converts heat energy into work during cyclic process is:", 
        options: ["Heat pump", "Heat engine", "Refrigerator", "Compressor"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "A heat engine converts heat to work in a cyclic process (e.g., Carnot cycle). Heat pumps and refrigerators move heat, and compressors increase pressure."
      },
      { 
        q: "Which refrigerant has the highest latent heat?", 
        options: ["Freon-12", "Ammonia", "Carbon dioxide", "R-134a"], 
        answer: 1,

        q: "Product of pressure and volume constant (PV = const):", 
        options: ["Gas law", "Boyle’s law", "Charles’ law", "Avogadro’s law"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Boyle’s law states PV = constant for a gas at constant temperature. Charles’ law involves volume and temperature, and Avogadro’s law relates moles."
      },
      { 
        q: "As temperature of I.C. engine increases, efficiency will:", 
        options: ["Decrease", "Increase", "Remain constant", "Become zero"], 
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "Excessively high temperatures in IC engines reduce efficiency due to heat losses and material limitations, despite higher theoretical efficiency."
      },
      { 
        q: "Nepal Vehicle Mass Emission Standard 2069 is equivalent to:", 
        options: ["ISO 9001", "Euro III", "Euro IV", "BS VI"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Nepal’s 2069 standard aligns with Euro III for vehicle emissions. ISO 9001 is quality management, and Euro IV/BS VI are stricter."

        q: "If hot and cold water are mixed, the entropy of the system will:", 
        options: ["Decrease", "Increase", "Remain constant", "Become zero"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Mixing hot and cold water is irreversible, increasing system entropy due to greater disorder. Entropy doesn’t decrease or remain constant."
      },
      { 
        q: "The change in internal energy of an ideal gas during an adiabatic process is:", 
        options: ["mCp ln(T₂ / T₁)", "mCv(T₂ − T₁)", "mR(T₂ − T₁)", "Zero"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "In an adiabatic process, ΔU = mCv(T₂ − T₁) for an ideal gas, as work changes internal energy (Q = 0). Other options are incorrect."
      },
      { 
        q: "The heating and expanding of a gas is called:", 
        options: ["Thermodynamic system", "Thermodynamic process", "Thermodynamic cycle", "Thermodynamic state"], 
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Heating and expanding a gas is a thermodynamic process. Systems, cycles, and states are broader concepts."
