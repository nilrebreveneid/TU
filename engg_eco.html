    "options": ["400 units", "500 units", "600 units", "700 units"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Breakeven point = Fixed Costs / (Selling Price - Variable Cost) = 10,000 / (50 - 30) = 500 units."

    "options": ["10%", "15%", "20%", "25%"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Solve NPV = 0: 6,000/(1 + r) + 6,000/(1 + r)^2 = 10,000. Trial and error or interpolation gives IRR ≈ 20%."
