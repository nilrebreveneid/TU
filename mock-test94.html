        options: ["Moment of inertia", "Radius of gyration", "Polar moment", "Section modulus"], 
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "The second moment of area, or moment of inertia, measures resistance to bending or torsion. Radius of gyration is a derived property, polar moment relates to torsion, and section modulus is for bending stress."

      { 
        q: "The maximum shear stress in a circular shaft under torsion occurs at:", 
        options: ["Outer surface", "Center", "Mid-radius", "Quarter-radius"], 
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "In a circular shaft under torsion, shear stress is maximum at the outer surface and zero at the center, following τ = Tr/J, where r is the radius."
      },

        q: "The bending moment at a point in a beam is the:", 
        options: ["Sum of moments about that point", "Sum of forces about that point", "Product of force and distance", "Shear force at that point"],

        q: "The shear force at a section of a beam is the:", 
        options: ["Sum of vertical forces on one side", "Sum of horizontal forces", "Moment about the section", "Twisting force"], 
        answer: 0,
